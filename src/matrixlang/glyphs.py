"""The 32-slot glyph table — D-03's fixed bijective mapping.

Pure data; imports nothing. Keys are the ASCII slot spellings from the
language spec §3.1; values are single half-width katakana (U+FF66–FF9D),
which render in any terminal with zero font work. The set is swappable:
if a real film-glyph font ever exists, only this table changes (§6.2).

Assignments are loosely mnemonic where a sound offered itself (ﾄ "to" for
trace, ﾚ "re" for redpill, ﾃ "te" for dejavu) and arbitrary elsewhere;
the tests pin bijectivity and coverage, not the choices.
